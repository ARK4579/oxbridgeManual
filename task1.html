				<li>Identify common appliances that run-on electricity.</li>
				<li>Construct a simple series electrical circuit, identifying and naming its basic parts, including cells, wires, bulbs, switches and buzzers.</li>
				<li>Identify whether or not a lamp will light in a simple series circuit, based on whether or not the lamp is part of a complete loop with a battery.</li>
				<li>Recognize that a switch opens and closes a circuit and associate this with whether or not a lamp lights in a simple series circuit.</li>
				<li>Recognize some common conductors and insulators, and associate metals with being good conductors.</li>
